# How to Play
Saves<br>
Roll a d20. If it’s equal to or under the relevant (current) Ability Score, you succeed.<br>
1 always succeeds. 20 always fails.<br><br>
Turns & Actions<br>
Players go before enemies, unless surprised.<br>
Roll a DEX Save to act on the first turn.<br>
Players take turns in any order.<br><br>
Actions<br>
On your turn, you can move and take one action: attack, flee, climb, etc.<br>
For risky actions, roll a Save (e.g. holding heavy stone = STR Save, dodge = DEX Save).<br><br>
Attacks<br>
Do not roll to hit, instead simply roll your weapon’s damage die, unless:<br>
Impaired (bad angle or grappled) = d2.<br>
Enhanced (helpless target or cool stunt) = d12.<br><br>
Damage<br>
Lose HP first. If HP hits 0, subtract further damage from STR. If STR hits 0, you’re dead! Environmental damage ranges from d4 to d12. Use d20 for truly deadly stuff.<br><br>
Resting & Recovery<br>
One ration and a sip of water restores all HP. A week of downtime in safety restores all damage dealt to STR.<br><br>
Deprived<br>
Without water or food you will be Deprived and gain no benefits from resting.
