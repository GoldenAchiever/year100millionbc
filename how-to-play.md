# How to Play
Saves
Roll a d20. If it’s equal to or under the relevant (current) Ability Score, you succeed.
1 always succeeds. 20 always fails.
Turns & Actions
Players go before enemies, unless surprised.
Roll a DEX Save to act on the first turn.
Players take turns in any order.
Actions
On your turn, you can move and take one action: attack, flee, climb, etc.
For risky actions, roll a Save (e.g. holding heavy stone = STR Save, dodge = DEX Save).
Attacks
Do not roll to hit, instead simply roll your weapon’s damage die, unless:
Impaired (bad angle or grappled) = d2.
Enhanced (helpless target or cool stunt) = d12.
Damage
Lose HP first. If HP hits 0, subtract further damage from STR. If STR hits 0, you’re dead! Environmental damage ranges from d4 to d12. Use d20 for truly deadly stuff.
Resting & Recovery
One ration and a sip of water restores all HP. A week of downtime in safety restores all damage dealt to STR.
Deprived
Without water or food you will be Deprived and gain no benefits from resting.
