You are barely human.  
The world is new and fire is rare.  
The world is cruel.  
Full of teeth and storms and hunger.
<br><br>

This is role-playing game about primitive humans. One person is the referee. They speak for the world: the loud beasts, all the angry things with hungry mouths. The others are players. They ask questions. They crawl through holes and they poke things with sticks. The referee tells them what happens, or tells them to roll some dice to find out what happens when discussion isn’t suitable to determine the outcome.  
You’ll need a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20), and something to write with.<br><br>
