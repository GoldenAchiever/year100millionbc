# Running Games
## Fire
Fire is both life and fear. Not everyone knows how to control it.  
Early humans didn’t invent fire, they found it from lightning strikes or wildfires. At first, they just kept it alive, carrying embers from place to place, while constantly feeding it.  
It is suggested that player characters do not begin with the knowledge of how to start fire. They may carry a burning branch, or find a wild flame, but the secret of fire must be learned.  
Let someone teach it to them: a wise elder or a strange hermit. Once they know, fire becomes a tool, but still fickle. Wet wood won’t burn. Wind kills weak sparks. Smoke attracts both Man-eaters and jelaous Rivals.
## Communication
Player characters can only speak in three-word sentences. This rule is might not be suitable for every play group, so feel free to ignore it. This game is yours, play it how you see fit.  
But if you lean into it, it can become a game of its own. Present players with problems that require cooperation. Watch them struggle to plan or warn with primitive sentences.  
A fire is spreading, a friend is trapped, or defusing an argument with a stranger. How to cross a ravine with a makeshift bridge? See what they say with only three words.
## Luck
When something comes down to luck, roll a d6. High is good for the players, low is bad. The referee decide what the roll means.
## Turns
A turn is the astract amount of time it takes to move and perform one action. Minor actions, like drawing a weapon, can replace movement.
